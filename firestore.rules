/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for NexGen Health Platform.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has a dedicated
 * data tree under `/users/{userId}`, and only the authenticated user (or an admin)
 * can access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user-related data (profile, prescriptions, health logs, alerts, chat logs)
 * is nested under `/users/{userId}`. This path-based ownership simplifies security rules.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled for privacy.
 * - The ruleset prioritizes security and simplicity, avoiding complex data validation
 *   during this prototyping phase. Data validation should be implemented at the
 *   application level.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The data structure denormalizes authorization context by utilizing path-based ownership for private data.
 * The `userId` parameter in each subcollection inherently grants access only to the corresponding user.
 * This approach avoids hierarchical authorization dependencies and enables atomic operations.
